Remote repository comes handy when youre working with a team, or when you are not close to your computer

Pushing and pulling manually is the better way because the you wouldn't
want to publish an unfinished feature to a remote repository, and vice-versa.

A git fork is a copy of a repository that doesn't belong to you on Github, a git clone is a copy of
someones github or git repository to an offline git repository, while git branch is
 a new commit made in parallel of the master commit in a git repository.


The best part of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally is the convenience it give you to be able to work and check for changes
anytime you like, without the need to be online(github).

 Without Git  and Github, collaborating will have be done by showing your changes
 to a colleague in person. Using Git and Github sure makes things easier and flexible.

 I'd prefer to make Changes on separate branches so as to preserve the basic functionality
 of the project I am working on, just in case I dont like the changes on the current branch I can just
 delete that particular branch
